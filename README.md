This was a Assignment to simply Fetch Data from an API and render the data in the JSX.It took me hardly 30-40mins to do this simple task.
I Used Fetch Javascript method to tackle the problem,we can also used Axios and render it using UseEffect, but keeping in simple i used Fetch Method.

Thanks For Assignment.
